# TunnelMessenger
The ultimate communication EXPERIENCE

This messenger is VERY COOL!	

The idea for this project, brought you by Tunnel Enterprises INC, is 
to bring you back the best aspects out of the legendary MSN Messenger,
while removing the shitty aspects out of the legendary MSN Messenger,
and adding the best aspects out of Facebook Messenger and other modern
tools. It is oldschool. It is shiny. It is chromy. It is glossy, smooth
to the touch.

Enjoy this fucking piece of glory.
